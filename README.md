Results-driven IT professional with CompTIA A+, Security+, AZ-500, GIAC GFACT, GSEC, and GCIH certifications. Two years of technical support experience in enterprise healthcare environments with hands-on skills in Windows administration, ticket triage, and incident response. Demonstrated proficiency in SIEM analysis (Splunk), vulnerability assessment (Nessus), and log analysis through SANS training, home labs, and platforms such as Let‚Äôs Defend and TryHackMe. Currently focused on Blue Team operations, malware detection, and SOC analysis workflows to transition into a full-time cybersecurity analyst role.

## Objective


I bring hands-on experience in SIEM monitoring, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, and I aim to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to protect and strengthen enterprise systems within a collaborative SOC environment.

## Tools
- **Splunk ‚Äî Built correlation searches to detect brute-force attempts (Event ID 4625); created dashboards for authentication trends; analyzed Windows Security logs to identify password-spray and privilege-escalation indicators.
- **NESSUS ‚Äî Conducted host vulnerability scans to identify outdated services and misconfigurations; interpreted CVSS scores and recommended remediation actions; documented scan results and false-positive validation steps.
- **Python ‚Äî Built a multithreaded TCP port scanner to enumerate open services and perform banner-grabbing

SANS Cyber Academy Hands on Training:

- **Wireshark ‚Äî Practiced traffic inspection and protocol dissection; identified abnormal flows indicative of data exfiltration.  
- **PowerShell ‚Äî Queried system artifacts, generated SHA256 hashes, and performed registry inspections.  
- **Sysinternals  ‚Äî Used Autoruns and Process Explorer to detect persistence and analyze startup items.  
- **Splunk / SIEM Concepts ‚Äî Interpreted simulated security event data to identify brute-force and malware patterns.  
- **Volatility / Memory Forensics Concepts ‚Äî Reviewed process listings and memory indicators for malicious code presence.  
- **RITA ‚Äî Detected known and new undiscovered attacker C2 using statistical anomaly analysis for network activity.
