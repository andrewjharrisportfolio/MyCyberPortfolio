Aspiring SOC Analyst with 6 years of IT support and customer support experience and a growing portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity skills, including log analysis, vulnerability remediation, and incident triage. Certified in GFACT, CompTIA Security+, Microsoft AZ-500, GIAC GSEC and currently pursuing the GCIH to deepen my defensive operations expertise.

I’ve worked directly in high-pressure healthcare environments supporting critical systems, triaging outages, verifying user access under HIPAA constraints, and escalating security-related tickets using ServiceNow. Through lab work and self-guided projects, I’ve used tools like Splunk to detect brute-force attacks, Nessus to remediate real vulnerabilities, and pfSense/Duo Security to enforce multi-layered access controls.

My focus now is fully on transitioning into a security operations role where I can contribute to threat detection, alert triage, and incident response while continuing to grow into threat hunting and IR responsibilities over time. I bring a balance of technical precision, calm under pressure, and a self-driven approach to continuous improvement.

Let’s connect if you're building a security team, hiring for a Tier 1 SOC role, or looking for a reliable candidate who’s ready to contribute from day one and grow quickly.
## Objective


My goal is to leverage my strong troubleshooting skills, knowledge of network security, and experience in technical support to contribute to an organization’s cybersecurity efforts. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am excited to bring my passion for security and problem-solving to a dynamic, collaborative team.
